# BfBB Practice Mod
A Practice Mod for the Xbox version of Battle for Bikini Bottom.

It features changes like:

-having all warps unlocked and both abilities at the start

-triggers for boss fights and key areas are visible

-the ability to reset levels back into an almost-original state

-generally makes tricks easier to practice

and more!

## How to install: Extract the zip, paste the files over **an unmodified xbox copy of the game** (crucial files are missing in this download so it will require a full version of the game), put it on a softmodded xbox (360) and run it

### Known Issues
-Pressing a reset level button with a textbox on screen (character, press R, yellow text, etc) will crash the game.

-No Bubbles on Loading Screens, this can be fixed by returning to the main menu then loading ingame.
