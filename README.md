# BfBB Practice Mod
A Practice Mod for the Xbox version of Battle for Bikini Bottom.

# Features

- visuals for boss fight skips, as well as visuals for key tricks

- tricks are much easier and faster to practice and retry

and more!

# Installation 

Extract the zip, paste the files over **an unmodified xbox copy of the game** (crucial files are missing in this download so it will require a full version of the game), put it on a softmodded xbox (360) and run it

# Known Issues

- Pressing a reset level button with a textbox on screen (character, press R, yellow text, etc) will crash the game.
    - Saving on intial state of level (before anything is touched) and reloading is suggested as reset buttons don't reset everything properly.

- Pressing Start doesn't unpause the game.   Yeah idk why this doesn't work I'm blaming Heavy Iron
