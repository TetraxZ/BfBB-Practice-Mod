- tricks are much easier and faster to practice and retry

and more!

# Installation 

Extract the zip, paste the files over **an unmodified xbox copy of the game** (crucial files are missing in this download so it will require a full version of the game), put it on a softmodded xbox (360) and run it

# Known Issues

- Pressing a reset level button with a textbox on screen (character, press R, yellow text, etc) will crash the game.
    - Trying to reset a textbox while it is on screen makes the game implode, so wait for the text to disappear.

- Pressing Start doesn't unpause the game, Unplugging controller doesn't bring up the screen
    - ~~I'm blaming Heavy Iron for this, a way to fix this is replace MNU3.HIP and MNU4.HIP with the original ones.~~ This is fixed on more recent versions of the mod.

- Reset buttons don't exist anymore or don't function properly.
    - My method of resetting levels is very janky so most buttons were removed until they work properly. Use the AutoCB mod which has a built-in reset function. (Keep Flags Off)
